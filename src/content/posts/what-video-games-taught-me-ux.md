I’ve spent a lot of time playing video games growing up.

At first it was just entertainment. A way to relax, compete with friends, or disconnect for a while.

But funny enough, many of the skills I use in tech today were shaped by games long before I realized it.

Looking back, they taught me more than I expected.

## Patience and persistence

Games are basically a series of problems.

You fail a level, try again, adjust your strategy, and repeat until something finally clicks.

Years later, debugging feels surprisingly similar.

When something breaks, I don’t immediately give up. I try again, change my approach, and keep experimenting. It’s the same mindset, just applied to code instead of a boss fight.
