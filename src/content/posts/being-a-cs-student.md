Sometimes it feels like everyone around you already has a clean plan.

They say things like *“I’m going to be a backend engineer”* or *“I’m focusing on AI”*, and they talk with this confidence that makes you wonder if you missed a memo. Meanwhile, you’re just trying to understand what you actually enjoy, what you’re good at, and what kind of work you want to do long-term.

For a while, that made me uncomfortable. I kept comparing myself to people who sounded more certain, and it turned into this quiet pressure in the background: *maybe I’m behind, maybe I’m doing this wrong, maybe I’m not “serious” enough.*

But the truth is, uncertainty isn’t a sign that you’re failing. It’s often a sign that you’re paying attention.

## But here’s what I realized

Most people don’t have everything figured out — not really. Some are just better at sounding sure, and others are repeating a path they’ve seen online because it feels safer than admitting they’re still exploring.

What helped me was realizing that “figuring it out” is part of the job. In computer science, you’re constantly learning new tools, new patterns, and new ways to think. So why would your career path be the one thing that’s perfectly clear from the start?

When I stopped treating uncertainty like a weakness, I started using it like a compass. Instead of trying to force a label, I paid attention to moments that made me feel genuinely interested: building a feature that finally clicks, fixing a bug that looked impossible at first, or improving something small that makes the experience smoother.

## What I’m focusing on now

Right now, I’m letting myself grow in multiple directions. I like building things, but I also enjoy testing and quality because it changes how you think. You stop asking only *“does it work?”* and start asking *“what could go wrong, and how do we prevent it?”*

That mindset has been shaping the way I approach projects. I still don’t have a perfect one-sentence label for myself, but I’m okay with that. I’d rather be someone who’s consistently improving than someone who picked a title too early and stopped exploring.

## The point

If you’re a CS student and you feel like you don’t have everything figured out, you’re not alone. You’re not late. You’re not broken. You’re just in the part of the journey where things are still forming — and that’s normal.

Sometimes the clearest direction comes after you’ve built enough things to understand what you actually want.
