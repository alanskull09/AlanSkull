Getting stuck is part of programming.

No matter how much experience you have, there will always be moments where nothing makes sense and every solution seems wrong.

I used to get really frustrated when that happened. I’d stare at the screen for hours, reread the same code, and somehow feel worse every minute.

Eventually I realized something simple: pushing harder isn’t always the answer.

Sometimes you need to step back.

## First, I slow down

When I’m stuck, my brain wants to rush.

“Try this. Change that. Maybe this works.”

But random changes usually create more confusion.

So now I pause and try to understand the problem calmly. I read the error messages again. I simplify the situation. I remove unnecessary parts.

Half the time, the solution appears just because I stopped panicking.

## Then I break it into smaller pieces

Big problems feel impossible. Small problems feel manageable.

So instead of fixing everything at once, I isolate one part.

Does this function work alone?  
Does the API respond correctly?  
Is the data what I expect?

Answering small questions builds momentum, and momentum builds clarity.

## Sometimes I just walk away

This one felt weird at first, but it helps more than anything.

If I’ve been stuck for too long, I step away from the computer.

Go for a walk. Drink water. Do something else for 10 minutes.

It sounds unrelated, but your brain keeps working in the background. More times than I can count, the solution pops into my head when I’m not even looking at the screen.

## Getting stuck is normal

I don’t see being stuck as failure anymore.

It’s just part of the process.

Every developer gets stuck. The difference is learning how to handle it without burning out.

Now I treat it like a puzzle, not a crisis.

And honestly, solving those moments is still one of the most satisfying parts of coding.
