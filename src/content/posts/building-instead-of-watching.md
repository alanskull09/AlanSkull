title: "Why I Prefer Building Instead of Just Watching Tutorials"

For a long time, I thought learning meant watching tutorials.

I’d open YouTube, pick a course, follow along, take notes, and finish the video feeling productive. It felt like progress because I understood what the instructor was doing — and for a moment, that was enough.

But eventually I noticed something: the moment I closed the tutorial and tried to build something alone, I’d freeze. It wasn’t because I didn’t “watch enough.” It was because watching and doing are different skills.

## The illusion of progress

Tutorials are comfortable. Everything works, the instructor never gets stuck, and the path is already decided. You never have to choose between two approaches, you never have to debug a messy issue, and you never have to deal with that feeling of *“wait… why is this not working?”*

And that’s exactly why tutorials can be misleading. They can make you feel like you’re learning quickly, while avoiding the hard part that actually makes you better: decision-making, problem-solving, and debugging your own mistakes.

The first time you build something without a guide, you learn what you *don’t* know — and that’s where real progress starts.

## Building forces you to think

When you build, there’s no script. You have to decide what to do first, how to structure your code, how to name things, and how to fix the weird issues that show up for no reason at 1 a.m.

You also learn to deal with uncertainty. Sometimes you try an approach and it fails. Sometimes the bug is your fault. Sometimes it isn’t. Either way, you’re learning how to move forward, not just how to follow instructions.

That process is slower than watching a video, but it sticks.

## How I use tutorials now

I don’t hate tutorials. I just treat them differently.

Now I use them like references, not like the main learning method. If I’m stuck on one small concept, I’ll watch a focused video, read docs, or check examples — then I go back to my own project and apply it immediately.

Because the goal isn’t to finish a playlist. The goal is to be able to build without one.

## The real win

The best feeling isn’t completing a course. It’s when you face a problem, struggle for a while, and then solve it with your own hands. Even if the solution is messy. Even if you refactor it later.

That’s how confidence is built: one real project at a time.
