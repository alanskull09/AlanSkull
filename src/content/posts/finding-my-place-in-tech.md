If you asked me a few years ago what I wanted to become, I probably wouldn’t have a clear answer.

Backend? Frontend? QA? Something else? I genuinely liked a bit of everything, and instead of feeling exciting, it started to feel confusing — mostly because I kept hearing the same advice: *“You need to specialize.”* Pick one thing. Commit to it. Become the best at that.

But I never felt like my brain worked that way. I wasn’t bored by variety — I was energized by it.

## I just like building things

What I enjoy most is the process: turning an idea into something real, improving it, breaking it, fixing it, and making it smoother.

Some days that looks like building features on the frontend. Other days it’s digging into backend logic, APIs, or authentication. And sometimes it’s purely QA work: reproducing a bug, writing a clean report, or creating tests that make sure it doesn’t come back.

For a while, I thought this meant I was indecisive. Now I think it means I’m curious — and that curiosity is useful.

## Labels are helpful… until they aren’t

The tech world loves labels because they make things easy to explain. The problem is that real people don’t always fit perfectly into one box.

I’ve met developers who love testing but don’t call themselves QA. I’ve met testers who can code better than many developers. I’ve met “frontend” people who spend half their time designing APIs because they care about the whole system.

So I stopped stressing about having a perfect label early. I started asking a better question: *What kind of problems do I want to work on?*

## What I’m leaning toward

Lately, I’ve been leaning more into QA and quality because it matches how I naturally think. I like understanding systems deeply, finding weak points, and improving reliability. I like the idea of shipping software that feels solid, not just “works most of the time.”

At the same time, I don’t want to lose the builder side of me. I still enjoy writing features and connecting backend to frontend, especially when it’s part of a real product.

So instead of forcing a strict identity, I’m building a path that includes both: the mindset of QA and the skills of a developer.

## Where I’m at right now

I’m still learning. I’m still exploring. But it doesn’t feel chaotic anymore — it feels intentional.

I don’t need to have everything figured out to keep moving forward. I just need to keep building, keep testing, and keep paying attention to the work that makes me want to come back the next day.
